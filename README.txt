Module 1: Arrays and Strings:

Task 1.1 - Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
Task 1.2 - Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
Task 1.3 - URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.
Task 1.4 - Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
            A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
            is a rea rrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
Task 1.5 - One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
            remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
            one edit (or zero edits) away.
Task 1.6 - String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
            of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the
            "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
            the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).
Task 1.7 - Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
            bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. (an you do this in place?
Task 1.8 - Zero Matrix: Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
            column are set to O.
Task 1.9 - String Rotation: Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring
            of another. Given two strings, S1 and S2, write code to check if S2 is a rotation of S1 using only one
            call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of"erbottlewat").

Module 2: Linked lists:

Task 2.1 - Remove Dups: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
            FOLLOW UP
            How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
Task 2.2 - Return Kth to Last: Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
Task 2.3 - Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but
           the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to
           that node.
Task 2.4 - Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come
           before all nodes greater than or equal to x. lf x is contained within the list, the values of x only need
           to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the
           "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
Task 2.5 - Sum Lists: You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single
            digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1 's digit is at the head of the list. Write a
            function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
Task 2.6 - Palindrome: Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.
